## Installation

EvoMol has been designed on Ubuntu (18.04+). Some features might be missing on other systems. Especially, the drawing of exploration trees is currently unavailable on Windows.


To install EvoMol on your system, run the appropriate commands in your terminal. The installation depends on <a href='https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual'>Anaconda</a>.

### Linux

```shell script
$ git clone https://github.com/jules-leguy/EvoMol.git     # Clone EvoMol
$ cd EvoMol                                               # Move into EvoMol directory
$ conda env create -f evomol_env.yml                      # Create conda environment
$ conda activate evomolenv                                # Activate environment
$ python -m pip install .                                 # Install EvoMol
```

### Windows

```shell script
$ git clone https://github.com/jules-leguy/EvoMol.git     # Clone EvoMol

## Quickstart

Launching a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.1243">QED</a> optimization for 500 steps. Make sure to activate the evomolenv conda environment when you use EvoMol.

```python
from evomol import run_model
run_model({
    "obj_function": "qed",
    "optimization_parameters": {
        "max_steps": 500
    },
    "io_parameters": {
        "model_path": "examples/1_qed"
    },
})
```

## Model parametrization

To run a model, you need to pass a dictionary describing the run to the run_model function. This dictionary can have up 
to 4 entries that are described in this section.

**Default values** are represented in bold.

## Drawing exploration trees

### Large exploration tree

Performing a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.1243">QED</a> optimization run of 500 steps, while 
recording the exploration data. 

```python
from evomol import run_model

model_path = "examples/2_large_tree"

run_model({
    "obj_function": "qed",
    "optimization_parameters": {
        "max_steps": 500},
    "io_parameters": {
        "model_path": model_path,
        "record_history": True
    }
})
```

Plotting the exploration tree with solutions colored according to their score. Nodes represent solutions. Edges 
represent mutations that lead to an improvement in the population.

```python
from evomol.plot_exploration import exploration_graph
exploration_graph(model_path=model_path, layout="neato")
```

### Detailed exploration tree

Performing the experiment of mutating a fixed core of acetylsalicylic acid to increase its 
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.1243">QED</a> value. 

```python
from evomol import run_model

model_path = "examples/3_detailed_tree"

run_model({
    "obj_function": "qed",
    "optimization_parameters": {
        "max_steps": 10,
        "pop_max_size": 10,
        "k_to_replace": 2,
        "mutable_init_pop": False
    },
    "io_parameters": {
        "model_path": model_path,
        "record_history": True,
        "smiles_list_init_path": "examples/acetylsalicylic_acid.smi"
    }
})
```

Plotting the exploration tree including molecular drawings, scores and action types performed during mutations.
Also plotting a table of molecular drawings.

```python
from evomol.plot_exploration import exploration_graph

exploration_graph(model_path=model_path, layout="dot", draw_actions=True, plot_images=True, draw_scores=True,
                  root_node="O=C(C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O", legend_scores_keys_strat=["total"], mol_size=0.3,
                  legend_offset=(-0.007, -0.05), figsize=(20, 20/1.5), legends_font_size=13)
```

## Environment variables and data requirements

### CLscore

As the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2020.00046/full"> CLscore </a> is dependent of prior 
data to be computed, EvoMol needs to be given the data location.
To do so, the ```$SHINGLE_LIBS``` environment variable must be set to the location of the shingle_libs folder that can
be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/reymond-group/GDBChEMBL"> here</a>.
 
### DFT and Molecular Mechanics optimization

To perform DFT and Molecular Mechanics computation (necessary for HOMO and LUMO optimization), you need to bind 
<a href="https://gaussian.com/glossary/g09/">Gaussian09</a> and 
<a href="https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-019-0372-5">OpenBabel</a> with EvoMol.

To do so, the ```$OPT_LIBS``` variable must point to a folder containing : 
* run.sh : a script launching a DFT optimization with Gaussian09 of the input filepath given as parameter.
* obabel/openbabel-2.4.1 : directory containing an installation of OpenBabel 2.4.1. Make sure to also set OpenBabel's
```$BABEL_DATADIR``` environment variable to ```$OPT_LIBS/obabel/openbabel-2.4.1/data```.

To install OpenBabel, you should compile <a href='https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/releases/tag/openbabel-2-4-1'> the sources </a> using the <a href='https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation/install.html#compiling-open-babel'>official instructions</a>.

### GuacaMol initial population

To use EvoMol for <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00839">GuacaMol</a> goal directed benchmarks 
optimization using the best scoring molecules from their subset of 
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/D1/D945/2605707">ChEMBL</a> as initial population, you need to :
* Download the <a href="https://figshare.com/projects/GuacaMol/56639">ChEMBL subset</a>.
* Give the path of the data using the ```"smiles_list_init_path"``` attribute.
* Insure that the ```"guacamol_init_top_100"``` attribute is set to True.
